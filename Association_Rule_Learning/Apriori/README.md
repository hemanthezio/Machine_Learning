Apriori Algorithm
==================
Bakery dataset is used which was collected from https://wiki.csc.calpoly.edu/datasets/wiki/ExtendedBakery
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset contains information about one-year worth of sales information for few bakery shops.
The sales are made by employees. The dataset contains information about the different store locations, 
the assortments of baked goods offered for sale and the purchases made.

A set containing 1000 transactions for 50 bakery items is used for determining the frequent item sets. 
The 50 items are made up of 40 pastries and 10 juices. The transactions are represented in the form of a binary vector of length 50 
in which a ‘1’ in a column indicates that particular item has been purchased in that transaction.

The names of the items is present in bakery_items.csv file which was extracted from the database
